Builds with CMake 2.8 or later.

This project is primarily written for GCC; MSVC support may have latent issues that may initially go undetected. There are no compiler specific defines or inline assembler used, but attention should be paid to abstracting calling conventions and the C++ ABI properly.


Build outputs:

d3d8.dll, intercepts standard Morrowind D3D functions and adds features.
dinput8.dll, a shim dll that redirects input to d3d8.dll, as all input processing functions are in d3d8.dll.
MGEXEgui, a .net GUI that configures MGE and generates the distant world files that allows long view ranges.
MGEfuncs.dll, a helper dll for MGEXEgui that processes Morrowind format models with niflib/tootlelib.


Build dependencies required:

DirectX SDK June 2010 or later: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/directx/
SlimDX: http://slimdx.org/
Tootle: http://developer.amd.com/archive/gpu/tootle/Pages/default.aspx
niflib: http://sourceforge.net/projects/niftools/files/niflib/

You will typically only require the DirectX SDK and SlimDX, the latter two are used solely by MGEfuncs.dll which is called by the distant land generator only.


Runtime dependencies required:

DirectX 9 June 2010, for the d3dx runtime library
SlimDX redistributable, for MGEXEgui
MWSE 0.9.4a dll (www.sourceforge.net/projects/mwse), the exact version is currently required as MGE XE directly calls unexported functions by offset to add new instructions to the VM.


Noted issues:

MGEfuncs.dll is not build automated yet; it is only written for MSVC (due to the MS format linkable libraries) and it's not ported to gcc yet.
